# IEC-CIM-conversion-services (Beta)
This repo contains the IECCimToPMG and PMGToIECCim conversion services that [RSE](https://www.rse-web.it/) developed. They developed these services to integrate PMG into their DSO platform. Since there is a broader interest in IECCimToPMG and PMGToIECCim conversion services they will open source these services and contribute them to the PMG project. In the future, these services may be integrated into [power-grid-model-io](https://github.com/PowerGridModel/power-grid-model-io). 

# Notable contributors
Our gratitude goes to the following contributors who have worked (and are still working) on these services before it became open source:
- Gabriele Paludetto (RSE)
- Francesca Soldan (RSE)
- Enea Bionda (RSE)
